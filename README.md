# 👋 Hi, I’m @RamdaniRamdane (a.k.a r3y0)

- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, system scripting, and creating efficient workflows on minimal Linux setups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Next.js and improving my skills in React for full-stack web development. I also explore Neovim and Eww (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets) customization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Linux customization, Next.js, and any MERN stack development.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect via GitHub or LinkedIn (insert your LinkedIn link).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my coding journey as a script kiddie in high school but soon embraced the beauty of structured programming with C. I also enjoy customizing my Arch Linux setup, making it minimal and efficient!
